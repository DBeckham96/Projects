    "## Project Summary\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction.** The project discusses an historical overview of Syrian refugee admission to the United States since the start of the Syrian Civil War in March 2011 to April 2017. It investigates where refugees settle in the United States by state and city, and the top receiving states and cities by population share. The project explores the questions: Where in the United States do Syrian refugees resettle? How many Syrian refugees have settled? What are top receive states and their population of share of refugees? What factors influece Syrian refugee resettlement? \n",
    "\n",
    "The project uses data from the Department of State Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, Office of Admissions - Refugee Processing Center reporting [website](http://ireports.wrapsnet.org/). A report was ran of refugee arrivals from Syria by destination from March 1, 2011 to April 30, 2017.\n",

    "## Explainer - Syrian Refugee Resettlement\n",
    "---\n",
    "About 3 million refugees have resettled in the U.S. since Congress passed the [Refugee Act of 1980](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/the-refugee-act) according to [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/30/key-facts-about-refugees-to-the-u-s/). According to this project's research using the Department of State Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration's data, the U.S. has resettled 20,525 Syrian refugees since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in March 2011\n",
    "\n",
    "This number is very low when compared to European countries, like Germany that has accepted 1 million Syrian refugees, or [55 times](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/05/04/germany-welcomed-more-than-1-million-refugees-in-2015-now-the-country-is-searching-for-its-soul/?utm_term=.a9edac37f736) more than the U.S. It is even lower when compared to countries neighboring Syria, like Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan that have accepted nearly 5 million Syrian refugees according to the [UN refugee agency](http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php)."

Half of the population – [11 million Syrians](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/21/how-meet-urgent-needs-11-million-syrians-fleeing-conflict) – have been killed or forced to flee.

    "**U.S. Resettlement Factors** \n",

    "Many factors limit refugee resettlement to the U.S., including wavering political commitment from the White House between Obama and Trump administrations. The Obama administration [committed](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/world/middleeast/obama-directs-administration-to-accept-10000-syrian-refugees.html) to resettle 10,000 refugees in September 2015 -- a goal surpassed. On the other hand, the Trump administration signed two executive orders to ban Syrian refugees -- [both](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html) [orders](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/us/politics/trump-travel-ban.html) were blocked by federal courts. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the U.S. refugee resettlement process is also a major factor. Unlike Europe, the U.S. admits refugees into the country only after processing. Europe processes refugees once they arrive on European soil. In the U.S., Refugees undergo an [‘extreme’](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/magazine/why-is-it-so-difficult-for-syrian-refugees-to-get-into-the-us.html) [vetting process](https://www.rescue.org/article/how-us-refugee-vetting-and-resettlement-process-really-works) that can take [more than two years](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/20/us/why-it-takes-two-years-for-syrian-refugees-to-apply-to-enter-the-united-states.html). They go through multiple agency background checks, finger print screenings, reviews, and interviews. It is a difficult process to resettle in the U.S. as a refugee.\n",

    "Since March 20011, the top three resettlement states for Syrian refugees are California, Michigan, and Texas. In California, Syrian refugees have mainly resettled in San Diego and Sacramento. In Texas, resettlement is more distributed across the major cities Houston, Austin, and Fort Worth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Michigan is a unique state for Syrian refugee resettlement because of its demographics. The city of Dearborn, 9 miles from Detroit, is home to one of the largest [Arab populations](http://michiganradio.org/post/what-explains-michigans-large-arab-american-community) in the U.S. According to the [2000 Census](https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-23.pdf),  29.85 per cent of the city is Arab, or 29,181 people of the city’s 97,775 total population. The metro-Detroit cities, like Sterling Heights, Warren, and Livonia, all have Arab populations of 100,000 or more. As Arab people migrate to Michigan and build communities, the network ties increase and social capital accumulates making the area receptive for resettlement for other Arab migrants, like Syrian refugees."
